# The-Blue-Swordsman
The Blue Swordsman video game -- Pygame needs to be downloaded and installed in the same folder as all these files, and to run it, run "The_Blue_Swordsman.py."

Hey all who download this! To play the game, it takes a bit to set it up. Put all the files in one folder, then,
if you don't already have it, download Pygame (which can be downloaded here: https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).
Copy that folder called "pygame" that it creates and just toss it into that folder with all the other files.

Enjoy the game!
