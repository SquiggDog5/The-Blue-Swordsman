# The-Blue-Swordsman
The Blue Swordsman video game -- Pygame needs to be downloaded and installed in the same folder as all these files, and to run it, run "The_Blue_Swordsman.py."

Hey all who download this! To play the game, it takes a bit to set it up.

The first thing to do is get Python, if you don't already have it (which can be downloaded here: https://www.python.org/downloads/). Download all of the
sound and image files by clicking on them and hitting the small download button. Then, to get the actual code files, create a new file with Python.
Click a code file on here to view them, then copy all the code and put them into the file you created. Make sure you name the files the same that they are named on here

Put all the files in one folder, then,if you don't already have it, download Pygame (which can be downloaded here: https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).
Copy that folder called "pygame" that it creates and just toss it into that folder with all the other files.

Enjoy the game!
